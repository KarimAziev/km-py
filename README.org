* About

=km-py.el= is a utility library that enhances the Python development experience in Emacs by integrating with several Python environment management systems such as =Poetry=, =Pipenv=, =virtualenv=, and =pip=.

It provides automatic configuration of Python LSP servers, virtual environment activation, and convenient shell-interaction functions, aiming to offer a seamless workflow for Python projects within Emacs.

* Installation

** With use-package and straight.el
#+begin_src elisp :eval no
(use-package km-py
  :demand t
  :after (python)
  :bind ((:map python-mode-map
          :package python
          ("C-<return>" . km-py-shell-send-buffer)
          ("C-c C-c" . km-py-shell-send-buffer)
          ("C-c C-y" . km-py-yank))
         (:map python-ts-mode-map
          :package python
          ("C-<return>" . km-py-shell-send-buffer)
          ("C-c C-c" . km-py-shell-send-buffer)
          ("C-c C-y" . km-py-yank)))
  :straight (km-py
             :repo "KarimAziev/km-py"
             :type git
             :host github)
  :commands (km-py-setup-enable)
  :config (km-py-setup-enable))
#+end_src

** Manual installation

Download the source code and put it wherever you like, e.g. into =~/.emacs.d/km-py/=

#+begin_src shell :eval no
git clone https://github.com/KarimAziev/km-py.git ~/.emacs.d/km-py/
#+end_src

Add the downloaded directory to the load path:

#+begin_src elisp :eval no
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/km-py/")
(require 'km-py)
#+end_src

* Usage

After installing or loading the library into your Emacs setup, you can enable the Python environment setup by calling =km-py-setup-enable=.

To disable the setup and all advised commands, use =km-py-setup-disable=.

** Other commands:

=M-x km-py-yank=:
Paste the current kill ring entry with adjusted indentation. The inserted text will have its leading indentation adjusted to match the current line's indentation. If the text to be inserted was indented, all lines will be reindented to match the current line's leading spaces and tabs.

=M-x km-py-shell-send-buffer=
This command is similar to =python-shell-send-buffer=, but it automatically runs an inferior Python process if it is not started.
